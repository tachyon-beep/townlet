# Audit Summary

## Executive Overview
Townlet delivers a rich simulation scaffold with comprehensive telemetry and promotion tooling, but key security and operational guardrails remain unimplemented. Admin console commands trust client-provided metadata, telemetry travels over plaintext TCP, and the monolithic `WorldState` makes high-risk changes difficult to review. Completing the highlighted work packages will unlock safer multi-user operations, better observability, and unlock pending feature flags (compact observations, affordance hooks).

## Key Metrics
- Source modules: 59 (`src/`), 27 CLI modules, 78 test modules
- Lines of code: 16807 (src) + 4233 (scripts) + 9509 (tests) = 30549
- Unit test coverage: Not measured (no coverage reports in repo)
- Docstring coverage: 11.0% (only 135 of 1225 callables documented)
- TODO markers: 3 active TODO(@townlet) markers (grid + observations)

## Findings by Category

**Security**
- Console/telemetry pipeline lacks authentication and trusts `mode` supplied by clients, enabling privilege escalation (`src/townlet/console/command.py:82-110`, `src/townlet/console/handlers.py:124-911`).
- Telemetry TCP transport is plaintext without endpoint trust (`src/townlet/telemetry/transport.py:56-183`).

**Operational**
- Telemetry buffer drops payloads after repeated send failures without emitting actionable alerts (`src/townlet/telemetry/publisher.py:430-520`).
- Logging for tick health is unstructured, limiting ingestion into monitoring tools (`src/townlet/telemetry/publisher.py:243-265`).

**Performance**
- Tick loop and world affordance resolution repeatedly traverse global agent collections, risking superlinear runtime as agent counts grow (`src/townlet/core/sim_loop.py:167-266`, `src/townlet/world/grid.py:1200-1500`).

**Code Quality**
- `WorldState` spans 2700 lines with 104 methods and TODO markers, obscuring affordance/economy responsibilities (`src/townlet/world/grid.py:51-2701`).
- Docstring coverage below 11%, leaving exported APIs undocumented.

**Best Practice**
- No Docker/container assets or deployment guides; runtime assumes local venv with implicit filesystem layout.

**Enhancement**
- Compact observation variant is stubbed out, preventing compact-flag configs from functioning (`src/townlet/observations/builder.py:285-303`).

**Technical Debt**
- Affordance hook registry defined but unused; TODO markers block extension points (`src/townlet/world/grid.py:1297-1330`).

## Top 10 Priorities
1. WP-101 – Secure Console & Telemetry Access Control
2. WP-102 – Encrypt Telemetry Transport & Add Endpoint Trust
3. WP-103 – Expose Telemetry Buffer Health & Dropped Payload Alerts
4. WP-104 – Decompose WorldState Into Focused Modules
5. WP-105 – Implement Compact Observation Variant
6. WP-106 – Wire Affordance Hooks Into World Execution
7. WP-107 – Add Container & Deployment Tooling
8. WP-108 – Adopt Structured Logging for Stability & Telemetry
9. WP-109 – Profile Tick Loop & Optimise Hot Paths
10. WP-110 – Raise Documentation & Docstring Coverage

## System Health Score
- **Overall score: 5/10**
    - Security: 3/10 (no auth, plaintext transport)
    - Operational readiness: 5/10 (buffered telemetry, but weak alerting)
    - Performance outlook: 6/10 (baseline in place, but scaling concerns)
    - Code quality: 5/10 (type hints solid, but large monolith + missing docs)
    - Documentation: 4/10 (docs exist, but API docstrings lacking)

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. Implement WP-101 and WP-102 to close the most severe security gaps before multi-user access.
2. Ship quick wins (WP-103, WP-105) to stabilise observability and unblock compact observation experiments.
3. Kick off WP-104 discovery to plan WorldState decomposition, reducing risk for subsequent behavioural features.
