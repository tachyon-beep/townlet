# Townlet Web Scaffold

Milestone 0 placeholder used to validate CI wiring for the spectator/operator web UI.

## Current State
- `package.json` with stub `lint`, `test`, and `build` scripts.
- `scripts/smoke.js` placeholder smoke check executed by the `npm run test` script.

## Next Steps
- Replace echo scripts with Vite/React tooling once Milestone 1 begins.
- Introduce ESLint/Prettier configuration and Storybook for component development.
- Wire this package into CI (see `docs/program_management/WEB_UI_SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for deployment requirements).
