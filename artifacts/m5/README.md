# M5 Behaviour Cloning Artefacts

- `preflight/` — synthetic rehearsal bundle used during preflight checks (deprecated once production
  datasets are validated).
- `acceptance/` — reserved for artefacts generated during Phase 5.4 acceptance runs (populate with
  anneal logs, PPO summaries, and decision notes).
