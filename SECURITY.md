# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Townlet is pre-release software. Security updates are provided on the `main`
branch until formal releases begin. Production deployments should pin to a
commit hash and track upstream changes closely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please disclose vulnerabilities via security@townlet.dev. Include:

- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce, including configuration details
- Suggested mitigations if known

We aim to acknowledge reports within three business days and provide status
updates weekly until resolution. Once a fix is available we will credit the
reporter (if desired) and document the remediation path.
