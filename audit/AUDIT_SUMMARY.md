# Audit Summary

## Executive Overview
Townlet delivers a well-structured simulation scaffold with rich domain modelling (agents, perturbations, telemetry, promotion) and a substantial automated test suite (81 pytest modules). The configuration stack leverages strict Pydantic models, and documentation across `docs/` mirrors the modular architecture. However, critical security hardening has not yet been implemented: console and telemetry endpoints accept unauthenticated clients, file operations are unsandboxed, and telemetry streams travel over plaintext TCP. Operational resilience is also at risk—telemetry flushing blocks the tick loop, and high-volume payloads amplify the chance of cascading failures. Performance hotspots centre on per-tick deep copies in telemetry and mutable world snapshots that expose the simulation to heisenbugs.

Despite these gaps, the codebase is consistent with Townlet's conceptual design: core subsystems are decomposed cleanly, tests exercise key behaviours (queue fairness, perturbations, telemetry, PPO helpers), and tooling support (scripts, GitHub Actions) is strong. Addressing the highlighted security and operational risks will unlock the path to productionising the simulator without sacrificing the flexibility needed for experimentation.

## Key Metrics
- Lines of code (Python): **30,110** total — `src/` 16,556, `scripts/` 4,089, `tests/` 9,465
- Python modules analysed: **164** (module documentation generated in `audit/MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Tests: **81** pytest files covering config loading, telemetry, scheduler, policy, world
- TODO markers: **3** remaining in source tree
- Modules lacking docstrings: **77** (primarily in `tests/`)

## Findings by Category
- **Security**: No authentication/authorization around console or telemetry surfaces (`src/townlet/console/handlers.py`, `townlet_ui`); snapshot commands permit arbitrary filesystem access; TCP telemetry lacks encryption (WP-001, WP-002, WP-003).
- **Operational**: Telemetry flushes block the simulation thread and drop payloads under back-pressure; limited structured logging/health signals hamper operations (WP-004, WP-007).
- **Performance**: Full world/relationship snapshots are rebuilt every tick, inflating payloads and CPU usage; mutable snapshots risk expensive defensive debugging (WP-005, WP-006).
- **Code Quality**: Dataclass copies are shallow, inviting accidental mutation; placeholder docstrings/TODOs linger in stability and policy scaffolding (WP-006, WP-010).
- **Best Practice**: No containerisation or deployment runbooks; insecure defaults (plaintext telemetry, viewer/admin trust) remain undocumented (WP-008).
- **Enhancement**: Training and promotion scripts are scaffolding-heavy; no closed-loop promotion pipeline yet (WP-009).
- **Technical Debt**: Remaining TODOs and scaffolding need consolidation into tracked issues or completed implementations (WP-010).

## Top 10 Priorities
1. **WP-001** – Harden console & telemetry access control (Security, CRITICAL)
2. **WP-002** – Sandbox snapshot & console file operations (Security, HIGH)
3. **WP-003** – Secure telemetry transport & authentication (Security, HIGH)
4. **WP-004** – Decouple telemetry flush from simulation loop (Operational, HIGH)
5. **WP-005** – Slim telemetry payloads & add diff support (Performance, MEDIUM)
6. **WP-006** – Defensive copying in world snapshots (CodeQuality, MEDIUM)
7. **WP-007** – Add health monitoring & structured logging (Operational, MEDIUM)
8. **WP-008** – Provide container & deployment blueprint (BestPractice, MEDIUM)
9. **WP-009** – Complete training & promotion pipeline (Enhancement, MEDIUM)
10. **WP-010** – Pay down placeholder & TODO backlog (TechnicalDebt, MEDIUM)

## System Health Score
**58 / 100** – Strong architectural foundations and automated tests anchor the system, but critical security controls are absent and telemetry infrastructure poses outage risks. Addressing the top four work packages will raise the score into the mid-70s.

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **Implement WP-001 & WP-002** together to close the most exploitable security gaps (auth + filesystem sandboxing).
2. **Prioritise WP-004** to ensure telemetry outages cannot stall the tick loop; add instrumentation (WP-007) in the same sprint for visibility.
3. **Schedule WP-003** immediately after WP-001 to encrypt external telemetry flows and prevent passive data leakage.

Delivering these items in the next sprint will materially de-risk Townlet while preserving momentum on longer-term enhancements.
