# Audit Summary

## Executive Overview
Townlet’s codebase is feature-rich with disciplined type hints, extensive pytest guardrails, and exhaustive automation scripts covering simulation, training, and telemetry workflows. The PettingZoo-compatible tick loop cleanly composes lifecycle, rewards, policy, and telemetry modules, while CI exercises complex anneal and rollout scenarios. However, two high-risk gaps remain: console authentication defaults allow privilege escalation, and telemetry infrastructure lacks resilience and secure defaults. Performance hotspot analysis also shows `WorldState` still performs O(n²) neighbourhood scans, threatening scale experiments. Addressing the highlighted work packages will harden security, stabilise observability, unlock compact observation variants, and set the stage for the ongoing WorldState refactor.

## Key Metrics

| Technical-debt ratio | 2 major monoliths flagged for refactor out of 68 src modules (~3%) |

## Findings by Category
- **Security**
  - Disabled console auth lets callers set `mode="admin"`, enabling unauthenticated privilege escalation (`src/townlet/console/auth.py:105-112`, default config `src/townlet/config/loader.py:623-638`).
  - TCP telemetry encourages plaintext transport unless operators hand-configure TLS, exposing data in transit (`src/townlet/config/loader.py:507-560`, `src/townlet/telemetry/transport.py:201-243`).
- **Operational**
  - Telemetry flush worker lacks exception guards or liveness reporting; any runtime error silently halts streaming (`src/townlet/telemetry/publisher.py:651-666`).
  - Simulation loop has no panic handling, so unexpected errors crash runs without telemetry alerts or clean snapshotting (`src/townlet/core/sim_loop.py:181-276`).
- **Performance**
  - `WorldState.local_view` rebuilds agent/object maps for every call, producing O(n²) cost as agent counts grow (`src/townlet/world/grid.py:1396-1459`).
- **Code Quality**
  - `WorldState` (≈2.7k LOC) and `PolicyRuntime` (≈1.5k LOC) concentrate multiple domains, raising regression risk and blocking modular testing (`src/townlet/world/grid.py:178-2700`, `src/townlet/policy/runner.py:1-1481`).
- **Best Practice**
  - Only 15.6% of public callables have docstrings, leaving exported APIs under-documented (`audit/MODULE_DOCUMENTATION.md`).
  - No Docker/devcontainer assets exist; deployment still relies on bespoke virtualenvs despite documented need (`docs/engineering/WORLDSTATE_REFACTOR.md`, absence of Dockerfile).
- **Enhancement**
  - Compact observation variant is placeholder zeros, blocking compact-mode experiments (`src/townlet/observations/builder.py:450-468`).
- **Technical Debt**
  - Affordance outcomes still lose affordance/object identifiers, complicating post-action telemetry analysis (`src/townlet/world/affordances.py:120-156`).

## Top 10 Priorities
1. **WP-301** – Harden console auth defaults to eliminate unauthenticated admin escalation.
2. **WP-303** – Guard telemetry flush worker failures and surface health metrics.
3. **WP-302** – Require secure telemetry transport defaults with TLS-first configuration.
4. **WP-305** – Introduce spatial indexing for local views to avoid O(n²) scans.
5. **WP-309** – Implement the compact observation variant with populated tensors.
6. **WP-306** – Decompose `WorldState` and `PolicyRuntime` into focused modules.
7. **WP-304** – Add simulation loop health and recovery hooks for structured failure handling.
8. **WP-307** – Raise API docstring coverage and generate developer reference docs.
9. **WP-308** – Provide reproducible containerisation and secrets guidance.
10. **WP-310** – Persist affordance outcome metadata with structured identifiers.

## System Health Score
- **Overall**: 6/10
  - Security: 4/10 (token auth exists but defaults unsafe; TLS opt-in still manual)
  - Operational readiness: 5/10 (strong telemetry surface, but worker resilience missing)
  - Performance outlook: 6/10 (baseline fine for small towns; indexing required for scale)
  - Code quality & maintainability: 6/10 (type hints & tests solid, but monolith modules remain)
  - Documentation & enablement: 5/10 (rich high-level docs, low API doc coverage, no container)

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. Ship WP-301 and WP-303 in the next sprint to close the most critical security and observability gaps; verify via `tests/test_console_auth.py` and targeted telemetry smoke tests.
2. Roll out WP-302 alongside documentation updates so operators can enable TLS before exposing telemetry or console endpoints.
3. Kick off WP-305 discovery and benchmarking, coordinating with the ongoing WorldState refactor (WP-306) to avoid duplicate churn.
