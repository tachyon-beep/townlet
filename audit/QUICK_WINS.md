# Quick Wins

These tasks deliver meaningful improvements within a day while aligning with the broader work packages.

## WP-103: Expose Telemetry Buffer Health & Dropped Payload Alerts
- Impact: High (restores observability for transport failures)
- Effort: S (2-8hrs)
- ROI: High
- Rationale: One-day change surfaces existing drop counters through health payloads and console alerts, preventing silent data loss.

## WP-105: Implement Compact Observation Variant
- Impact: Medium (unblocks compact-observation experiments)
- Effort: S (2-8hrs)
- ROI: High
- Rationale: Completing the TODO converts placeholder tensors into actionable inputs, unlocking config variants without touching core loop.

## WP-108: Adopt Structured Logging for Stability & Telemetry
- Impact: Medium (makes tick health machine-readable)
- Effort: S (2-8hrs)
- ROI: Medium
- Rationale: Key/value logs immediately enable log aggregation tooling and faster incident triage.

## WP-110: Raise Documentation & Docstring Coverage
- Impact: Medium (improves developer velocity)
- Effort: S (2-8hrs)
- ROI: Medium
- Rationale: Targeted docstrings across exported APIs reduce onboarding time and future review churn with low implementation cost.
