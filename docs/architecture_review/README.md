# Architecture Review Archive

The `retired/` folder contains historical architecture review assets that informed earlier refactors of Townlet. They remain available for context when tracing decisions but should not be treated as active plans.

- Move new proposals into `engineering/` as RFCs, or into `work_packages/` when the work is scoped with milestones.
- If an older document becomes relevant again, lift it out of `retired/` into a new location with an accompanying status note.

When adding new material keep the directory structure shallow and prefer brief status tl;dr sections at the top of each file so stakeholders can skim quickly.
