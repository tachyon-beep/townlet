# WP2 Status

- Planning/analysis (Steps 0â€“1) completed: responsibilities mapped, ADR alignment confirmed, observation strategy decided (wrap existing builder initially).
- Package skeleton (Step 2) created with placeholder modules (`context`, `state`, `spatial`, `agents`, `actions`, `observe`, `events`, `rng`, `systems`).
- WP1 Step 4 (loop refactor) deferred to this work package.
- Next: proceed with Step 3 (extract stateless components) and flesh out skeleton implementations.

Update as tasks progress.
