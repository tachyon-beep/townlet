# WP2 Status

- Planning/analysis (Steps 0â€“1) completed: responsibilities mapped, ADR alignment confirmed, observation strategy decided (wrap existing builder initially).
- Package skeleton (Step 2) created with placeholder modules (`context`, `state`, `spatial`, `agents`, `actions`, `observe`, `events`, `rng`, `systems`).
- Stateless helper extraction (Step 3) complete: spatial index and observation helpers migrated, event dispatcher formalised with unit tests.
- Step 4 in progress: enriched `AgentRegistry` with metadata/tick bookkeeping and implemented the new `WorldState` container (RNG seeding, ctx-reset queue, event buffering). Unit tests cover both modules.
- WP1 Step 4 (loop refactor) deferred to this work package.
- Next: continue Step 4 by threading the new world state into adapters/factories prep work, then move on to Step 5 (action pipeline scaffolding).

Update as tasks progress.
