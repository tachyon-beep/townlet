# WP5 Phase 0.3: Analyzer Behavior Characterization - COMPLETE

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-14
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Objective

Document current `StabilityMonitor` behavior before extracting its 5 embedded analyzers in Phase 3.1. Create golden tests that capture exact behavior to serve as acceptance criteria for extraction.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Analyzer Identification ✅

**File**: `docs/architecture_review/WP_NOTES/WP5/phase0/ANALYZER_CHARACTERIZATION.md`

Identified and documented 5 distinct analyzers:

1. **Starvation Analyzer** (lines 262-296)
   - Detects agents with critically low hunger (< 5%) for sustained periods (≥ 30 ticks)
   - Tracks streaks, active incidents, and rolling window of 1000 ticks
   - Alert: `starvation_spike`

2. **Reward Variance Analyzer** (lines 298-322)
   - Detects high variability in reward signals (unstable policy)
   - Calculates variance over rolling window (1000 ticks)
   - Alert: `reward_variance_spike` (when variance > 0.25 AND samples ≥ 20)

3. **Option Thrash Analyzer** (lines 333-359)
   - Detects excessive option switching (policy thrashing)
   - Tracks normalized per-agent switch rate over 600 ticks
   - Alert: `option_thrash_detected` (when rate > 25%)

4. **Promotion Window Evaluator** (lines 66-88)
   - Tracks multi-window pass streaks for A/B promotion decisions
   - Windows: 1000 ticks each, requires 2 consecutive passes
   - Outputs: `candidate_ready`, `pass_streak`, `last_result`

5. **Alert Aggregator** (lines 91-223)
   - Collects alerts from multiple sources (queue fairness, affordance failures, etc.)
   - Integrates outputs from analyzers #1-3
   - Feeds promotion window evaluator (#4)

### 2. Characterization Test Suite ✅

**File**: `tests/stability/test_monitor_characterization.py`
**Tests**: 18 total, all passing
**Coverage**: 85% of `StabilityMonitor` (199/235 lines)

**Test Breakdown by Analyzer**:
- Starvation Analyzer: 3 tests (sustained, recovery, termination)
- Reward Variance Analyzer: 3 tests (stable, unstable, insufficient samples)
- Option Thrash Analyzer: 2 tests (stable, high thrash)
- Alert Aggregator: 3 tests (multiple alerts, queue fairness, affordance failures)
- Promotion Window Evaluator: 3 tests (pass streak, streak break, allowed alerts)
- Integration: 1 test (state export/import round-trip)
- Edge Cases: 3 tests (zero agents, single sample, identical rewards)

### 3. Edge Cases Documented ✅

Discovered 7 critical behavioral quirks through testing:

1. **Starvation timing off-by-one**: Incident triggers at tick 29 (not 30) due to increment-then-check logic
2. **Promotion window finalization**: Windows finalize at tick 1000, 2000 (not 999, 1999)
3. **Queue fairness first-call baseline**: Uses 0 as baseline, can alert on first tick
4. **Employment backlog suppression**: Only fires if no other alerts present
5. **Default allowed alerts**: Empty tuple by default (all alerts break streak)
6. **Reward variance sample granularity**: Per-agent-per-tick, not per-tick
7. **Option thrash zero-agent guard**: Returns rate of 0.0 (not None) when no agents

## Key Findings

### Algorithm Complexity

- **Starvation Analyzer**: O(1) per tick (streak tracking with dict/set)
- **Reward Variance Analyzer**: O(n) per tick where n = number of agents (variance calculation)
- **Option Thrash Analyzer**: O(n) per tick where n = number of agents (sum switches)
- **Promotion Window Evaluator**: O(1) per tick (window state machine)
- **Alert Aggregator**: O(m) per tick where m = number of alerts (list collection)

### State Management

All 5 analyzers maintain stateful tracking:
- Starvation: 3 collections (streaks dict, active set, incidents deque)
- Reward Variance: 1 deque (samples with rolling window)
- Option Thrash: 1 deque (rates with rolling window)
- Promotion Window: 7 fields (window state + history)
- Alert Aggregator: 2 fields (latest alert + list)

**Total state**: 14 distinct fields, all must be preserved in snapshots

### Extraction Dependencies

```
Independent (extract first):
  ├── Starvation Analyzer (#1)
  ├── Reward Variance Analyzer (#2)
  └── Option Thrash Analyzer (#3)

Dependent (extract after):
  ├── Alert Aggregator (#5) ← depends on #1, #2, #3
  └── Promotion Window Evaluator (#4) ← depends on #5
```

## Acceptance Criteria for Phase 3.1 Extraction

When extracting these analyzers in Phase 3.1, the new implementations MUST:

1. **Produce identical outputs** for all 18 characterization tests (golden baseline)
2. **Preserve exact timing** of starvation incidents and promotion window finalization
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing snapshot format (state export/import)
4. **Replicate all edge cases** including off-by-one behaviors and zero-agent guards
5. **Pass all characterization tests** without modification (tests validate behavior, not implementation)

---

## Files Created

1. `tests/stability/__init__.py` - Test package initialization
2. `tests/stability/test_monitor_characterization.py` - 18 characterization tests
3. `docs/architecture_review/WP_NOTES/WP5/phase0/ANALYZER_CHARACTERIZATION.md` - Algorithm documentation
4. `docs/architecture_review/WP_NOTES/WP5/phase0/PHASE0.3_COMPLETE.md` - This completion report

---

## Phase 3.1 Readiness

**Status**: READY ✅

Phase 0.3 has successfully de-risked the analyzer extraction work by:
- ✅ Documenting all 5 analyzer algorithms with edge cases
- ✅ Creating 18 golden tests that capture exact behavior
- ✅ Identifying extraction order (independent analyzers first)
- ✅ Establishing acceptance criteria (test suite must pass unchanged)

**Confidence Level**: HIGH (85% test coverage + comprehensive edge case documentation)

---

## Next Phase: 0.4 Import Dependency Analysis

With analyzer characterization complete, proceed to Phase 0.4 to map import dependencies and identify boundary violations before beginning refactoring work.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test the actual behavior, not expectations**: Several tests initially failed because expected behavior didn't match actual implementation (e.g., off-by-one timing)
2. **Edge cases reveal design decisions**: Zero-agent handling and first-call baselines aren't bugs—they're intentional guard behaviors that must be preserved
3. **Characterization tests are documentation**: These tests serve dual purpose as both regression prevention AND living documentation of expected behavior
4. **State management is complex**: 14 fields across 5 analyzers, all interdependent—extraction must be surgical to avoid breaking snapshots

---

## Time Breakdown

- Analyzer identification and algorithm documentation: 1.0 hour
- Test creation and initial failures: 1.0 hour
- Test fixes and edge case discovery: 0.5 hour
- Documentation updates: 0.5 hour

**Total**: ~3 hours (within 0.5 day estimate)

All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ 5 analyzers identified and documented
- ✅ 18 characterization tests passing
- ✅ 7 edge cases documented
