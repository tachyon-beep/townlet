## Manual Security Analysis

### 1. Dangerous Function Calls ✅

**Checked for**:
- `eval()` / `exec()` - Code execution
- `pickle` - Arbitrary code execution
- `yaml.load()` - Code execution (unsafe YAML)
- `__import__()` - Dynamic imports
- `subprocess` - Shell command execution
- `os.system()` - Shell command execution

**Result**: ✅ **NONE FOUND**

### 2. File Operations 🟡

**Found**: 1 file write operation in `promotion.py:214`

```python
def _log_event(self, record: Mapping[str, object]) -> None:
    if self._log_path is None:
        return
    try:
        self._log_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        with self._log_path.open("a", encoding="utf-8") as handle:
            payload = dict(record)
            payload["state"] = self.snapshot()
            handle.write(json.dumps(payload) + "\n")
    except Exception:  # pragma: no cover - logging best effort
        return
```

**Security Assessment**:
- ✅ Path is provided via constructor (controlled by caller)
- ✅ Opens file in append mode (`"a"`)
- ✅ Explicit UTF-8 encoding specified
- ✅ Uses JSON serialization (safe)
- ✅ Wrapped in try/except (graceful failure)
- ✅ Creates parent directories with `parents=True, exist_ok=True` (safe)
- ⚠️ No path traversal validation (relies on caller)

**Risk Level**: LOW
**Mitigation**: Already adequate (path controlled by trusted caller)

### 3. Input Validation 🟢

**Import State Methods**:
- `StabilityMonitor.import_state()` (monitor.py:251-330)
- `PromotionManager.import_state()` (promotion.py:162-196)

**Security Features**:
- ✅ Type checking with `isinstance()` before accessing nested data
- ✅ Safe coercion via `coerce_int()` / `coerce_float()` with defaults
- ✅ String conversion with `str()` for untrusted data
- ✅ Bool conversion with `bool()` for flags
- ✅ Defensive defaults for missing/malformed data
- ✅ No direct dictionary subscripting (uses `.get()` with defaults)

**Example** (monitor.py:251-258):
```python
def import_state(self, payload: Mapping[str, object]) -> None:
    streaks = payload.get("starvation_streaks", {})
    if isinstance(streaks, dict):
        self._starvation_streaks = {
            str(agent): coerce_int(value) for agent, value in streaks.items()
        }
    else:
        self._starvation_streaks = {}
```

**Risk Level**: VERY LOW
**Assessment**: Excellent defensive programming

### 4. JSON Operations ✅

**Found**: 2 JSON operations
1. `json.dumps()` in promotion.py:217 (serialization only)
2. `import json` in promotion.py:5

**Security Assessment**:
- ✅ Only uses `json.dumps()` (safe serialization)
- ✅ No `json.loads()` (no deserialization of untrusted data)
- ✅ No `json.load()` with file handles

**Risk Level**: NONE

### 5. Data Flow Security 🟢

**External Data Sources**:

```
StabilityMonitor.track() receives:
  ├─ tick: int                        [Trusted: SimulationLoop]
  ├─ rewards: dict[str, float]        [Trusted: RewardEngine]
  ├─ terminated: dict[str, bool]      [Trusted: LifecycleManager]
  ├─ queue_metrics: dict[str, int]    [Trusted: PolicyController]
  ├─ embedding_metrics: dict[str, float] [Trusted: ObservationService]
  ├─ job_snapshot: dict[str, dict]    [Trusted: EmploymentService]
  ├─ events: Iterable[dict]           [Trusted: WorldRuntime]
  ├─ employment_metrics: dict         [Trusted: EmploymentService]
  ├─ hunger_levels: dict[str, float]  [Trusted: World state]
  ├─ option_switch_counts: dict[str, int] [Trusted: PolicyController]
  └─ rivalry_events: Iterable[dict]   [Trusted: RivalryService]
```

**Assessment**:
- ✅ All inputs from trusted internal subsystems
- ✅ No user-controlled input
- ✅ No network input
- ✅ No file input (except log output)

**Risk Level**: VERY LOW

### 6. Integer Operations 🟢

**Potential for Integer Overflow**:

**Checked**:
- Deque operations (bounded by rolling windows)
- Arithmetic operations (variance, mean, rate calculations)
- Streak counters (unbounded accumulation)

**Found**:
```python
# monitor.py:369
streak = self._starvation_streaks.get(agent_id, 0) + 1
self._starvation_streaks[agent_id] = streak
```

**Assessment**:
- ⚠️ Theoretically unbounded (streak could grow infinitely)
- ✅ Practically bounded (max streak = ticks in simulation, typically < 1M)
- ✅ Python integers have arbitrary precision (no overflow)
- ✅ Streak resets on recovery (line 378) or termination (line 383)

**Risk Level**: NONE (Python integers don't overflow)

### 7. Division by Zero 🟢

**Checked**:
```python
# monitor.py:410-411 (variance calculation)
mean = sum(values) / sample_count
variance = sum((value - mean) ** 2 for value in values) / sample_count

# monitor.py:442 (option thrash rate)
rate = total_switches / float(agents_considered)
```

**Protection**:
```python
# monitor.py:439-441
agents_considered = active_agent_count or len(option_switch_counts)
if agents_considered <= 0:
    agents_considered = 1  # Guard against division by zero
```

**Assessment**:
- ✅ Explicit guard for division by zero (line 440-441)
- ✅ Early return when no samples (line 403-404, 408-409)

**Risk Level**: NONE

- Try/except for best-effort logging

### 2. No Dangerous Patterns ✅

- No code execution (`eval`, `exec`)
- No dynamic imports
- No shell command execution
- No pickle deserialization
- No unsafe YAML loading

### 3. Safe Data Handling ✅

- Immutable data structures where appropriate
- Defensive copying with `dict()`, `list()`, `set()`
- Bounded deques with `maxlen` (promotion.py:27)
- Type-safe coercion functions

### 4. Graceful Failure ✅

- Logging wrapped in try/except (promotion.py:212-219)
- Malformed input handled with defaults (import_state methods)
- No unhandled exceptions in critical paths

## Identified Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Path Traversal in Log File (LOW)

**Location**: `promotion.py:17`, `promotion.py:214`

**Issue**: `log_path` is user-controlled (passed via constructor)

**Attack Scenario**:
```python
# Malicious caller could pass:
PromotionManager(config, log_path=Path("/etc/passwd"))
```

**Current Mitigation**:
- Log path is only used internally (not exposed to network/user input)
- Caller is always trusted code (SimulationLoop)
- File opened in append mode (doesn't overwrite)

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Additional Mitigation** (optional):
- Validate log_path is within expected directory
- Reject absolute paths outside project root

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT RISK (caller is trusted)

### Risk 2: Unbounded Deques (LOW)

**Location**: `monitor.py:42,44,45`

**Issue**: Deques for `_starvation_incidents`, `_reward_samples`, `_option_samples` have no `maxlen`

**Attack Scenario**:
- Long-running simulation with many agents
- Deques grow unbounded
- Memory exhaustion

**Current Mitigation**:
- Rolling window expiration (items removed after window_ticks)
- Typical window size: 600-1000 ticks
- Maximum agents: 10
- Expected deque size: < 10,000 items

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Additional Mitigation** (optional):
- Add `maxlen` to deques (e.g., `maxlen=100_000`)

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT RISK (bounded by rolling windows)

### Risk 3: JSON Serialization of Arbitrary Objects (VERY LOW)

**Location**: `promotion.py:217`

**Issue**: `json.dumps(payload)` serializes `self.snapshot()` which contains arbitrary dict values

**Attack Scenario**:
- Malicious data in snapshot could cause large JSON output
- Log file could grow unbounded

**Current Mitigation**:
- Snapshot contains only internal state (no user input)
- Log rotation should be handled externally (not stability's responsibility)
- Logging is best-effort (catches Exception)

**Risk Level**: VERY LOW

**Recommendation**: ACCEPT RISK (internal data only)

## Recommendations for Phase 3.1 Extraction

### Required (Security-Critical)

1. **Maintain Input Validation Patterns** ✅
   - Continue using `isinstance()` checks in analyzer `import_state()` methods
   - Use `coerce_int()` / `coerce_float()` for numeric data
   - Provide safe defaults for missing/malformed data

2. **No Dangerous Functions** ✅
   - Do not introduce `eval`, `exec`, `pickle`, or shell commands
   - Keep using safe JSON serialization

3. **Type Safety** ✅
   - Maintain type annotations
   - Use defensive type checking at boundaries

### Optional (Defense in Depth)

1. **Add Deque Bounds** (Low priority)
   ```python
   # Before (unbounded)
   self._reward_samples: deque[tuple[int, float]] = deque()

   # After (bounded)
   self._reward_samples: deque[tuple[int, float]] = deque(maxlen=100_000)
   ```

2. **Validate Log Path** (Very low priority)
   ```python
   def _validate_log_path(self, path: Path) -> Path:
       """Ensure log path is within project directory."""
       resolved = path.resolve()
       if not resolved.is_relative_to(Path.cwd()):
           raise ValueError("Log path must be within project directory")
       return resolved
   ```

3. **Add Docstrings for Security Assumptions** (Documentation)
   ```python
   def import_state(self, payload: Mapping[str, object]) -> None:
       """Import state from snapshot.

       Security: Assumes payload is from trusted source (SnapshotManager).
       Validates types but does not sanitize against malicious data.
       """
   ```

---

## Security Testing Recommendations

### For Phase 3.1

1. **Fuzz Testing** (Optional)
   - Feed malformed data to `import_state()` methods
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - No crashes or unhandled exceptions

2. **Boundary Testing** (Optional)
   - Test with empty collections
   - Test with very large deques (> 1M items)
   - Test with negative numbers, NaN, infinity

3. **Integration Testing** (Required)
   - Verify characterization tests still pass (already done)
   - No new security regressions
