# WP4.1: Final WP1-4 Completion & Documentation Reconciliation

**Status**: 🟡 PLANNING
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5.5 days (includes Phase 0 risk reduction)
**Objective**: Bring WP1, WP2, WP3 to 100% completion (or approved deviations)

## What is WP4.1?

WP4.1 is a synthetic work package created to complete the remaining gaps in WP1-4:

- **Phase 0: Risk Reduction** (0.5-1 day): Reconnaissance and validation before execution
- **Phase 1: WP3 Completion** (1-2 days): Integrate `RewardBreakdown` DTOs into reward engine
- **Phase 2: WP1 Documentation** (1 day): Reconcile Context/Runtime/Adapter architecture confusion
- **Phase 3: WP2 Documentation** (1 day): Update ADR-002 to reflect actual implementation

This work package follows the successful completion of WP3.2 (100%) and WP4 (100%), bringing the entire WP1-4 roadmap to completion.

## Key Findings

### Good News
1. ✅ `TelemetryEventDTO` already exists and is enforced in `TelemetrySinkProtocol`
2. ✅ `RewardBreakdown` DTO already exists (just needs integration)
3. ✅ Most architectural work is documentation, not code changes
4. ✅ WP3 is actually ~85% complete (not 75% as reported)

### Work Required

1. 🔴 **Phase 0** (CRITICAL): Risk reduction reconnaissance (prevents costly mistakes)
2. 🔴 **Phase 1** (Highest Priority): Integrate Reward DTOs into reward engine
3. 🟡 **Phase 2** (High Priority): Document Context/Runtime architecture
4. 🟢 **Phase 3** (Medium Priority): Update ADR-002 with actual world structure

---

## Approved Deviations

Per project guidance: *"deviations are permitted but they must be objectively better"*

### ✅ Keeping These Deviations
1. **World Package Structure** — Refined subdirectories (core/, observations/, affordances/, agents/, systems/) instead of flat layout
2. **Telemetry DTO Enforcement** — Already enforced in port contracts (delivered early)
3. **Policy DTOs Early Delivery** — WP4 completed before full WP3 (natural parallelization)

### ⚠️ Resolving These Issues
1. **Context/Runtime Naming** — Three different "context"/"runtime" concepts need reconciliation
2. **ADR-002 Out of Sync** — Describes flat world package; actual is refined with subdirectories

## Execution Phases

### Phase 0: Risk Reduction (NEW!)

**Duration**: 0.5-1 day | **Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL

Tasks:

1. Map reward engine structure and consumers (RR1)
2. Analyze Context/Runtime dependencies (RR2)
3. Validate world package structure (RR3)
4. Establish test baseline (RR4)
5. Validate reward DTO compatibility (RR5)
6. Create Phase 1 test strategy (RR6)

**Outcome**: De-risked execution, no surprises in Phase 1-3

### Phase 1: Complete WP3 (Reward DTO Integration)
**Duration**: 1-2 days | **Priority**: 🔴 HIGHEST

Tasks:
1. Update `src/townlet/rewards/engine.py` to return `RewardBreakdown` DTOs
2. Update `src/townlet/core/sim_loop.py` to use DTOs for rewards
3. Update reward tests to expect DTOs

**Outcome**: WP3 at **100%** (all cross-boundary DTOs enforced)

### Phase 2: WP1 Documentation (Context/Runtime Reconciliation)
**Duration**: 1 day | **Priority**: 🟡 HIGH

Tasks:
1. Investigate three Context/Runtime concepts
2. Create CONTEXT_RUNTIME_RECONCILIATION.md
3. Update ADR-001 with architecture clarifications

**Outcome**: WP1 at **95%+** (architectural clarity achieved)

### Phase 3: WP2 Documentation Update
**Duration**: 1 day | **Priority**: 🟢 MEDIUM

Tasks:
1. Update ADR-002 to reflect actual world package
2. Create module relationship diagrams
3. Update CLAUDE.md with correct references

**Outcome**: WP2 at **95%+** (documentation matches reality)

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification (Continuous)
**Duration**: 0.5 day | **Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL

Continuous validation after each phase:
- All 816+ tests passing
- Type checking clean
- Linting clean
- Coverage ≥85%

---

## Success Criteria

### Completion Targets
- WP1: ~90% → **95%+**
- WP2: ~85% → **95%+**
- WP3: ~85% → **100%**
- WP3.2: 100% (maintained)
- WP4: 100% (maintained)

**Overall**: ~89% → **96%+**

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All 816+ tests passing
- ✅ Zero type errors (`mypy src`)
- ✅ Zero lint errors (`ruff check src tests`)
- ✅ 85%+ code coverage
- ✅ All ADRs accurate and up-to-date

---

## Timeline

**Optimistic**: 4 days (includes Phase 0)
**Realistic**: 5.5 days (includes Phase 0)
**Pessimistic**: 7 days (with buffer for unexpected issues)

## Next Steps

1. **Review PHASE0_RISK_REDUCTION.md** — Understand risk reduction activities
2. **Review WP4.1_PLAN.md** — Understand detailed execution plan
3. **Execute Phase 0** — Risk reduction reconnaissance (CRITICAL - do this first!)
4. **Execute Phase 1** — Reward DTO integration (informed by Phase 0)
5. **Track Progress** — Update EXECUTION_LOG.md daily
6. **Validate Continuously** — Run tests after each task
7. **Sign Off** — Complete SIGN_OFF.md when all phases done
