# WP3.1 â€” Stage 6 Recovery Plan

**Purpose:** Realign the codebase with the WP3 Stageâ€¯6 target state that was reported complete on 2025-10-11, but not reflected in the repository. WP3.1 captures the remediation required to remove the remaining legacy shims, enforce DTO-only policy/telemetry flows, and reconcile documentation with reality.

---

## Objectives
- Eliminate the console command queue shim so telemetry routing relies solely on dispatcher events.
- Retire transitional adapter/world accessors and expose DTO-centric interfaces only.
- Remove `ObservationBuilder` and all legacy observation batch dependencies from runtime, tooling, and tests.
- Update documentation, status trackers, and guard tests to represent the true Stageâ€¯6 state.
- Re-run the Stageâ€¯6 verification bundle (pytest, ruff, mypy, docstring checks) and record the results.

## Workstreams & Entry Points
| # | Workstream | Primary Doc | Status |
|---|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Console Queue Retirement | `console_queue_retirement.md` | âœ… COMPLETE |
| 2 | Adapter Surface Cleanup | `adapter_surface_cleanup.md` | âœ… COMPLETE |
| 3 | ObservationBuilder Retirement | `observationbuilder_retirement.md` | âœ… COMPLETE (Core) / ðŸ”„ Final cleanup |
| 4 | Documentation & Verification Alignment | `documentation_alignment.md` | ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS |

Each workstream document contains numbered implementation steps with explicit
file targets, commands, and acceptance criteria.

## Execution Order & Gates
1. **Workstream 1** â€” eliminate `queue_console_command` everywhere and ensure
   console suites pass before proceeding.
2. **Workstream 2** â€” remove adapter/world escape hatches; block advancement
   until adapter + orchestration suites pass with the DTO-first surface.
3. **Workstream 3** â€” delete `ObservationBuilder` only after Workstreams 1 and 2
   are merged. Gate on `rg "ObservationBuilder"` returning only the guard test
   plus green DTO parity.
4. **Workstream 4** â€” refresh docs/status and execute the verification sweep
   once code changes are complete.

## Tracking & Reporting
- Record execution notes and command outputs in `docs/architecture_review/WP_NOTES/WP3.1/stage6_recovery_log.md` (created during implementation).
- Update `docs/architecture_review/WP_NOTES/WP3/status.md` only after all recovery tasks are complete and validated.

- **Result**: WS3 100% COMPLETE, 0 runtime ObservationBuilder references

**WS4: Documentation & Verification Alignment - COMPLETE** (2025-10-13)
- âœ… All 4 work package status files synchronized (WP1, WP2, WP3, WP3.1)
- âœ… WP3/status.md updated with comprehensive Stage 6 Recovery section
- âœ… WP1/status.md updated (blockers cleared, next steps defined)
- âœ… WP2/status.md updated (adapter cleanup acknowledged)
- âœ… Assessment complete (see `ws3_completion_assessment.md`)
- âœ… Recovery log updated with all execution notes

### Final Metrics

| Metric | Value |

## WP3.1 Stage 6 Recovery â€” âœ… COMPLETE

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: All 4 workstreams complete, all validation passing, documentation synchronized

**Achievements:**
- Console queue shim completely removed (0 references)
- Adapter escape hatches eliminated (clean port surface)
- ObservationBuilder fully retired (1059 lines â†’ modular encoders)
- 120+ tests passing across all affected areas
- All 4 work package status files brought into sync

**Impact:**
- âœ… Unblocks WP1 Step 8 (ports-and-adapters pattern complete)
- âœ… Unblocks WP2 Step 7 (adapter surface cleaned)
- âœ… Stage 6 alignment complete (reported status matches reality)

See `ws3_completion_assessment.md` and `stage6_recovery_log.md` for comprehensive details.
