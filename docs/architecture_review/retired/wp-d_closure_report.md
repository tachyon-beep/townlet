# WP-D – Telemetry Pipeline Refactor: Closure Report

Date: $(date -u)

## Summary

WP‑D refactored telemetry into aggregation → transform → transport layers, aligned the simulation loop to a protocol surface, hardened worker/transport behavior, added built‑in metrics, and delivered benchmarking scripts. Key consumers (console, snapshots, scripts) now depend on `TelemetrySinkProtocol` with stub‑safe fallbacks.

## Deliverables

- Protocols:
  - Loop‑facing `TelemetrySinkProtocol`: src/townlet/core/interfaces.py
  - Pipeline protocols: src/townlet/telemetry/interfaces.py
- Aggregation/Transform/Transport:
  - src/townlet/telemetry/aggregation/*, src/townlet/telemetry/transform/*, src/townlet/telemetry/transport.py
- Worker management:
  - src/townlet/telemetry/worker.py with backpressure strategies and counters
- Stub parity:
  - src/townlet/telemetry/fallback.py
- Console/consumer migration:
  - src/townlet/console/handlers.py (bridge + protocol‑safe getters)
- Built‑in metrics:
  - Queue peaks, flush durations, batch counts, totals, send failure counters
- Benchmarking toolkit:
  - src/townlet/benchmark/utils.py; scripts/wp_d_benchmark.py; scripts/wp_d_benchmark_compare.py
- Documentation:
  - docs/guides/telemetry_pipeline.md
  - docs/guides/wp-d_upgrade_guide.md
  - docs/architecture_review/wp-d_phase7_runbook.md

## Validation Artifacts

- Targeted gates & results: tmp/wp-d/validation/phase9.txt
- 500‑tick telemetry stream: tmp/wp-d/validation/phase9_telemetry.jsonl
- 2000‑tick soak telemetry stream: tmp/wp-d/validation/phase9_long_telemetry.jsonl
- Benchmark JSONs (ad‑hoc): tmp/wp-d/benchmarks/*.json; comparisons under tmp/wp-d/benchmarks/*

## Residual Notes

- Phase 0 original baseline commands used `base.yml`; repository provides `configs/examples/poc_hybrid.yaml`. Modern baselines captured and archived; schema tables available via transform validators, not as a standalone table doc.
- mypy across the full repository remains noisy (baseline). Telemetry subset validated during Phase 9. No regressions observed in targeted suites.
- Buffer drop warnings are expected with default buffer thresholds under high throughput; sweep mode provided to tune `max_buffer_bytes`, `flush_interval_ticks`, and `worker_poll_seconds`.

## Closure

All WP‑D core objectives have been implemented and validated. Benchmarking tools and documentation are in place. Recommend closing WP‑D and tracking any further enhancements under WP‑G (observability ratchet) and follow‑on task tickets.
