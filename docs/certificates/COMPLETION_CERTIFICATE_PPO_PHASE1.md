# Completion Certificate â€” PPO Integration Package (Phase 1)

**Project:** Townlet Conflict-Aware Training

**Milestone:** PPO Integration Package, Phase 1 (Model + Config Scaffolding)

**Date:** 2025-09-26

## Summary
- Added `PPOConfig` to the simulation schema, enabling configurable PPO hyperparameters via YAML.
- Delivered conflict-aware Torch policy/value network scaffolding with runtime guards; training harness exposes `build_policy_network`.
- Extended replay tooling and CLI (`scripts/run_training.py`) with `--train-ppo`, batching, streaming, and JSONL logging options.
- Tests cover configuration loading, schema guards, torch availability, forward pass (when torch installed), replay batching, streaming iterator, and PPO stubs.

## Validation
- `source .venv/bin/activate && pytest`
- `source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/run_training.py configs/examples/poc_hybrid.yaml --replay-manifest docs/samples/replay_manifest.json --replay-batch-size 2 --train-ppo --epochs 2 --ppo-log docs/samples/ppo_log.jsonl`

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: implement true PPO losses (clipped surrogate, value loss, entropy bonus) with optimizer state and GAE.
- Phase 3: extend telemetry/NDJSON logging for queue conflict stats during training.
- Phase 4: integrate with live rollouts and finalise documentation.
