# Phase 4 Acceptance Report — Social Foundations Completion

**Project:** Townlet Conflict-Aware Training  
**Milestone:** M4 – Social Foundations (Relationships, Observations, Social Rewards, Narration)  
**Date:** 2025-09-30

## Scope
Phase 4 extends the rollout→PPO bridge (Phases 2–3) and closes the social foundations milestone.
Deliverables:
- Persistent relationship systems + social observation snippets (Phases 4.1/4.2)
- Phase C1 social rewards with guardrails and drift protection (Phase 4.3)
- Narration throttle, telemetry schema 0.7.0, observer UI narration overlays (Phase 4.4)
- Ops/QA governance (Phase 4.5)

## Scenario Coverage & Drift
| Scenario | Mode | Rollout Ticks | Queue Conflict Events | Intensity Sum | Artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| queue_conflict | mixed (replay→rollout) | 40 | 32.0 | 52.75 | `artifacts/phase4/queue_conflict/` (`ppo_mixed.jsonl`, `watch.jsonl`, `summary.md`) |
| employment_punctuality | mixed | 60 | 39.0 | 58.50 | `artifacts/phase4/employment_punctuality/` |
| rivalry_decay | mixed | 50 | 32.0 | 48.00 | `artifacts/phase4/rivalry_decay/` |
| observation_baseline | rollout control | 30 | 0.0 | 0.00 | `artifacts/phase4/observation_baseline/` |
| queue_conflict soak | alternating cycles | 12 cycles | 384.0 | 633.0 | `artifacts/phase4/queue_conflict_soak/` |

Baseline thresholds documented in `docs/ops/queue_conflict_baselines.md` (no drift beyond tolerance).

## Social Reward Validation
- RewardEngine integrates Phase C1 chat rewards with need override + termination window guardrails.
- Deterministic PPO drift suite (`tests/test_training_replay.py::test_ppo_social_chat_drift`) compares
  against `tests/golden/ppo_social/baseline.json`.
- Feature flag tooling `scripts/manage_phase_c.py` supports schedule overrides for staged rollout.

## Narration Telemetry & UI
- Telemetry schema bumped to **0.7.0**: `narrations` payload + persisted limiter state (`narration_state`).
- Priority-aware limiter implemented (`src/townlet/telemetry/narration.py`), fed into
  `TelemetryPublisher` and surfaced in observer dashboard’s Narrations panel.
- Ops handbook updated with tuning guidance, response playbook, and tooling commands.

## CI Integration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now includes:
  - Social telemetry/UI regression step: `pytest tests/test_telemetry_narration.py tests/test_observer_ui_dashboard.py tests/test_telemetry_client.py` (local runtime ≈0.7 s).
  - Mixed-mode queue_conflict validation with artefact upload (`tmp/ci_phase4/{ppo_mixed.jsonl,watch.jsonl,summary.md}`).
- Telemetry validator & watcher commands remain in CI to guard schema/metric drift.

## Documentation & Ops Artefacts
- `docs/ops/OPS_HANDBOOK.md`: mixed-mode workflow + narration troubleshooting.
- `docs/rollout/ROLLOUT_SCENARIOS.md`: scenario commands cross-referenced.
- `docs/program_management/M4_SOCIAL_FOUNDATIONS_EXECUTION.md`: execution log with risk statuses.
- `docs/program_management/snapshots/`: go/no-go prep (`M4_GO_NO_GO_PREP.md`, `...INVITE.md`, `...PRECHECKLIST.md`).

## Acceptance Checklist
- [x] Rollout→PPO bridge exercised across scenario catalog with artefacts archived.
- [x] Social reward drift suite and goldens committed; tests run in CI/local.
- [x] Telemetry schema 0.7.0 published with narration throttle; observer UI updated.
- [x] Ops documentation refreshed (mixed-mode workflow, narration controls, queue baselines).
- [x] CI workflow updated (social telemetry tests + artefact upload) — dry-run validated locally (<1 s added).
- [x] Soak harness (12 cycles) captured with watcher/summary outputs and no regressions.
- [x] Go/No-Go prep completed (artefact bundle, invite, checklist) — decision logged below.

## Decision
✅ **Go** — 2025-09-30  
Milestone M4 Social Foundations is complete; proceed to M5 (Behaviour Cloning & Anneal).
