# Work Packages

This folder tracks major refactoring and feature initiatives. Each Markdown file captures the context, scope, and acceptance criteria for a specific work package.

Use the naming convention `WORK_PACKAGE_<FOCUS>.md` and include:

- **Problem statement** summarising why the work is required.
- **Milestones** or phases with explicit exit criteria.
- **Dependencies and owners** so project planning tools can reference the document directly.
- **Validation plan** with the tests, dashboards, or metrics that confirm completion.

Archive completed packages by appending a closure summary at the bottom rather than deleting the file; this keeps the rationale and learnings searchable.
