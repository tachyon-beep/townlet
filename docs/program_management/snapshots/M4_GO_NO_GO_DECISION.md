# M4 Social Foundations Go / No-Go Decision (2025-09-30)

- **Participants:** Delivery lead (async approval), RL/Training lead (async approval), Ops/Telemetry lead (async approval), DevEx Rep (async approval)
- **Artefacts Reviewed:** Queue conflict & social scenario logs (`artifacts/phase4/...`), social reward drift tests, telemetry schema 0.7.0 changelog, ops handbook updates, observer dashboard narration capture (pending screenshot).
- **Decision:** ✅ **Go** — proceed to M5 Behaviour Cloning & Anneal.

## Rationale
- Relationship systems, social observations, social rewards, and narration controls all meet acceptance criteria.
- Ops documentation, tooling, and CI coverage updated to reflect new controls (narration throttle, social drift tests, artefact uploads).
- No blocking risks outstanding; remaining follow-ups (dashboard screenshot, CI runtime capture post-merge) tracked as action items.

## Action Items
| Owner | Task | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DevEx | Capture dashboard screenshot highlighting narration panel & attach to artefact bundle | 2025-10-01 |
| QA | Capture CI runtime after expanded suite lands and update invite notes | 2025-10-02 |
| Delivery | Kick off M5 planning session & update roadmap | 2025-10-03 |

## Notes
- Decision recorded asynchronously; no live meeting held. Artefact bundle and invite stored in
  `docs/program_management/snapshots/`.
