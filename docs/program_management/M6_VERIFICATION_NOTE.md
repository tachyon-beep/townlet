# Milestone M6 – Observer Experience & Policy Inspector

## Verification Summary (2025-10-06)

- **Scope Covered:** transport schema 0.9.0, observer dashboard panels (telemetry, employment, conflict, anneal, policy inspector, relationship overlay, KPIs, narrations, agents, map), policy inspector telemetry sourcing, console interplay, narration throttling, regression/ruff sweeps.
- **Testing Artefacts:** see `artifacts/m6/verification/` for dashboard transcript, telemetry sample, and test sweep summary.
- **Deferred Work:** audio toggle/config controls (Phase 6E). Pending design decision—flagged for follow-up.

## Checklist

| Phase | Step | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6A | Requirements alignment | ✅ | Scope confirmed against PROJECT_PLAN and HLD. |
| 6B | Telemetry transport verification | ✅ | Tests updated for schema 0.9; smoke suites pass. |
| 6C | Observer UI panels | ✅ | CLI run captured; panels render as documented. |
| 6D | Policy inspector data | ✅ | PolicyRunner snapshot + TelemetryClient parsing verified; tests green. |
| 6E | Audio toggle & config | ⚠️ Deferred | No config entries or docs; to revisit post-M6. |
| 6F | Console & narration interplay | ✅ | `scripts/console_dry_run.py` run; narration limiter tests pass. |
| 6G | Regression & performance | ✅ | Targeted pytest, performance timing (~23 ms/tick), ruff clean; mypy debt noted. |
| 6H | Artefacts & trackers | ✅ | Bundle saved; trackers updated. |

## Next Actions

1. Implement/configure audio toggle (config + ops docs) once UI decision lands.
2. Address outstanding mypy violations in `townlet_ui` (`telemetry.py` float coercions, untyped helpers) as technical debt.
3. Proceed with Phase 6E follow-up and remaining M6 tasks (Observer UI usability capture, etc.).
