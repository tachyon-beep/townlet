# Social Dashboard QA Checklist

## Purpose
Use this guide to validate the Rich observer dashboard after the social telemetry updates. It covers the configuration switches required to surface data, automated checks to run, and a short manual exercise for visual confirmation.

## Required Configuration
- Ensure the simulation config enables relationship tracking. The default example `configs/examples/poc_hybrid.yaml` already sets `features.stages.relationships: "B"`. Any config under test must keep this stage **off** the value `"OFF"`.
- Leave `telemetry.transport.type` as `stdout` (the default in local examples) so the dashboard can read snapshots without a network backend.
- Optional: raise `telemetry.transport.buffer.flush_interval_ticks` to `1` (also the default) to keep the social event feed responsive during manual runs.

## Automated Sanity Tests
Run the targeted dashboard tests to ensure social panels render both populated and empty states:

```bash
pytest tests/test_observer_ui_dashboard.py::test_social_panel_renders_with_summary_and_events \
       tests/test_observer_ui_dashboard.py::test_social_panel_handles_missing_summary
```

These cover the happy-path (relationships emitting data) and the stage-disabled path (panel shows the status banner plus placeholders).

## Manual Verification
1. Launch the observer dashboard against the standard hybrid scenario:
   ```bash
   python scripts/observer_ui.py configs/examples/poc_hybrid.yaml --ticks 1200 --refresh 0.8
   ```
2. Allow the simulation to run for ~600 ticks so agents chat and rivalry avoidance events trigger.
3. In the "Social" panel confirm:
   - "Social Ties" lists at least one agent with trust/familiarity values.
   - "Churn" shows the active window and either totals or the "(no evictions)" placeholders.
   - "Social Events" includes recent `chat_success` and `rivalry_avoidance` entries as agents interact.
4. Optional guard-rail check: edit the config temporarily to set `features.stages.relationships: "OFF"`, rerun the dashboard, and verify the status banner reads `Relationships telemetry unavailable (stage OFF or not yet emitted)` while the tables show placeholder rows.

## Troubleshooting
- If the Social panel stays empty after several hundred ticks, double-check the stage setting and confirm agents are not all terminated (inspect the "Agents" panel for active rows).
- When running long sessions, keep the refresh interval at â‰¥0.5s to avoid flooding the console; social telemetry flushes every tick so fast refreshes provide little extra detail.
