"""Protocol defining the world runtime boundary for the simulation loop.

This module defines the WorldRuntime port protocol, which enforces typed DTO boundaries
between the simulation loop and world implementations. All world runtimes must implement
this protocol to ensure consistent data exchange.

The protocol uses DTOs from townlet.dto.observations for all observation-related data,
ensuring type safety and validation across the boundary.

class WorldRuntime(Protocol):
    """Minimal contract for advancing the world runtime.

    This protocol defines the interface that all world runtime implementations must satisfy.
    It enforces DTO-based boundaries for observations, ensuring type safety and validation.

    The canonical implementation is `townlet.world.runtime.WorldRuntime`, which provides
    a stateful faÃ§ade coordinating world tick sequencing.

    Note: This is a structural protocol (@runtime_checkable). Concrete implementations
    are NOT required to inherit from this protocol; they only need to provide compatible
    methods with matching signatures.

    Naming Convention:
        The concrete implementation class shares the name "WorldRuntime" with this protocol.
        This is intentional and works correctly because:
        1. Structural typing allows this pattern (PEP 544)
        2. Different namespaces prevent confusion (ports.world vs world.runtime)
        3. The concrete class naturally fulfills the protocol contract
        4. The adapter pattern cleanly wraps the concrete implementation

    DTO Enforcement:
        - observe() returns ObservationEnvelope (townlet.dto.observations)
        - All observations use typed DTOs rather than raw dicts
