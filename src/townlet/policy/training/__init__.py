"""Policy training strategies and orchestration.

This package provides the training infrastructure for policy learning, including:
- Training strategies (BC, PPO, Anneal)
- Training services (Rollout, Replay, Promotion)
- Training orchestrator fa√ßade
- Context and state management

The package is designed with torch isolation in mind - services are importable
without PyTorch, while strategies require torch and check availability at runtime.
